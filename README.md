## Font Matching and Detection

```
    Analyzes image to identify text regions.
    Extracts features from the text relevant to font style (e.g., character shapes, serifs, stroke variations).
    Recommends matching fonts from a database.
    Provides confidence scores for each recommendation.
```

## Technology Stack 

```
    Python (programming language)
    OpenCV (computer vision library) - for text segmentation and pre-processing
    TensorFlow/PyTorch (deep learning frameworks) - for font feature extraction and classification
```
## Project Setup

```
    Install required libraries (refer to specific library documentation for installation instructions).
    Download a font database (to be specified).
    Configure file paths for the image input, font database, and model weights (if pre-trained model is used).
```
## How to Use:

```
    Place the image containing text in the input_image folder.
    Run the script (app.py).
    The script will generate recommendations for matching fonts along with confidence scores in the output folder.
```
### Note :
```
    This is a work-in-progress project.
    The accuracy of recommendations depends on factors like image quality, text complexity, and the comprehensiveness of the font database.
